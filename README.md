really interesting given it gives you the opportunity to find more information, pretty straight forward and following 
instructions on its usage I got to read what he had to share. At the end needed to still make a research in google given
the repositories he uses ["yourorg"]("github.com/yourorg/genkit") at least to the date 23/01/2025 had any information related
, after  looking for that repository did not find the information he was supposed to share.
Found the Googles repository with the imports needed to use his snippet. 

The real idea about using this command is finding a way that make work some ideas, this was the installation that did
not worked. 

# !!! DANGER
```bash
go install github.com/yourorg/genkit/cmd/genkit@latest
```

# Safe zone
```bash
go install github.com/firebase/genkit/go
```
